Custom Spawn Locations is a Project Zomboid mod.

## Profession spawn
All spawn chances are partly based on the size of the location and department as well as playability. Burger places and diners that is situated super off have a lower chance of spawn then a mid-town diner for instance.
The Knox County spawn location option spawns you in on a random location based on the spawn chances in the table below. Town specific spawn you in the designated town and will limit the randomness for obvious reasons (see police officer).
